

OVERVIEW:
PYGGEL (PYthon Graphical Game Engine and Libraries) is an Opengl powered 2d/3d game engine.
It supports 3d models, lights, shadows, etc. as well as a wide array of 2d operations, such as images and blitting.


Site:
	PYGGEL has a google code page and a google group for discussion:
		http://code.google.com/p/pyggel/
		http://groups.google.com/group/pyggel-dev
	There are also various other sites, but those are the main ones, and where you should start :)


REQUIREMENTS:
Python version 2.5 (possibly 2.6, but no official support, higher versions to be supported later)
Pygame version 1.8.1 or higher (lower may work)
PyOpenGL version 3.0.0 or higher (untested on lower, but may work)
Numpy version 1.2.1 or higher (untested on lower)

OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Python Imaging Library 1.1.6 or higher (untested on lower) (required for animated GIF support)


Documentation, Tutorials and examples:
DEMO:
	Currently PYGGEL includes one demo called Robocalypto. To start:
	From the commandline: cd into the Robocalypto directory and execute python run_game.py
	Elsewhere: Double click run_game.py in the Robocalypto directory
Docstrings:
	There are doc strings for every class, method and function.
Tutorials and examples:
	There are a few tutorials/examples in the examples_and_tutorials directory.
	It is strongly recommended you read through them first, because they explain and document things more fully than the docstrings.
HTML documentation:
	Currently none. It is planned for the next release, and if you need help with anything in the meantime, please ask on the Google Group,
	or send an email to roebros@gmail.com
