Pyggel (Python Graphical Game Engine + Libraries) will ease the learning curve of getting into 3d programming, while also having a strong enough framework for full-sized applications.

There is a google group for discussing anything about the project (bugs, development on the lib itself, any projects using it, help, etc.) located at:
"http://groups.google.com/group/pyggel-dev"
Anyone is welcome to come and discuss.
