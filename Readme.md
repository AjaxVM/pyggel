# PYGGEL (PYthon Graphical Game Engine and Libraries)

Lightweight, OpenGL powered, 2d/3d game engine - with the main goal of ease of learning/use and rapid prototyping.

## In Development

## Installation
### This section is WIP

Optional Dependancies are in `optinal-requirements.txt`, and are:
 * msgpack (binary message format for net library that is faster/smaller than json)
 * pyassimp (model loading - requires the compiled dynamic library (dll/so/dynlib) to be available on PATH or one of the places documented here: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/tree/master/port/PyAssimp#install
